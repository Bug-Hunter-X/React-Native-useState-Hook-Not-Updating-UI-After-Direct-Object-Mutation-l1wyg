This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native with an object or array.  If you directly modify the object or array within the state variable, React won't detect the change, and the UI won't update.  This is because React does a shallow comparison of the state.  
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [myState, setMyState] = useState({ count: 0 });

  const increment = () => {
    myState.count++; // Incorrect: Direct mutation
    setMyState(myState); // React won't detect this change
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{myState.count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
};
```
